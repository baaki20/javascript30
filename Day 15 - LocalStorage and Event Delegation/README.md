🚀**Day 15 of 30 Days of JavaScript Journey** 🚀

Today's project was all about enhancing user interaction! 🌟 Designed a dynamic form that empowers users to seamlessly add items to a list. 📝✨

🔗 Customized checkboxes add a touch of personalization, enabling easy checking and unchecking of items. The magic doesn't stop there - persistent storage ensures added and checked items survive page reloads! 🔄🚀

🧹 And for those moments when a clean slate is needed, a button gracefully clears the list.

Excited about the progress and the user-centric features coming to life! 🌐💡
