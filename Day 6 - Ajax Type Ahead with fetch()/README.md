🚀 Day 6 of 30 Days of JavaScript Journey! 🌐💻

Exciting progress today as I dove into the world of dynamic filtering! 🧭✨ Created a project that effortlessly filters through a list of  cities and states in the US. As you type, a magical list of suggestions appear, unveiling not only the city and state but also their population. 🌆🔍

🛠️ Leveraged the power of JavaScript to create a seamless and interactive search experience. 💬💡
